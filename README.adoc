== UPDATE: HOW TO INSTALL (2023)
++++
<p><b>You can no longer download directly from the Repo and receive the .pkg file for installation.</b></p>
<p>You must first fork the repo, activate 'actions', make a modification, and commit your changes for the .pkg build to occur. Watch the video below for the instructions.</p>
